# simple_proj
This is a micro-project used to test release flows from Landi's internal github
to external client VCS and Hosting Platforms.

### Setup Procedure

##### Step 1
Must create a PAT that is registered as a repository secret within both the
Landi Repo: `li-argonauts/simple_proj`
& Customer Repo: `todd-miller/simple_proj`

*note: These repos don't have to have the same name whatsoever, I just did
that so I could keep track of them more easily*
